# JustWatch Search

A web application that allows users to search for movies and TV shows on JustWatch and fetches all available streaming offers across all countries.

## üéØ Features

- **Homepage Display**: See upcoming Hollywood movie & TV series releases and popular titles by default
- **Release Date Information**: View release dates with countdown (days until release)
- **Search Functionality**: Search for movies and TV shows from the JustWatch database
- **Streaming Availability**: View streaming availability across multiple countries
- **Price Comparison**: Compare prices and platforms
- **Modern UI**: Responsive UI built with Blazor WebAssembly
- **CORS-enabled Proxy**: Server for API access
- **Railway Deployment Ready**: Easy deployment to Railway without Docker

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project consists of two main components:

1. **JustWatchProxy** - A C# ASP.NET Core API that acts as a proxy to the JustWatch API
   - Configurable port via `PORT` environment variable (default: 8080)
   - Supports deployment on platforms like Railway with dynamic port assignment
2. **JustWatchSearch** - A Blazor WebAssembly frontend application
   - Configurable proxy URL via `appsettings.json`
   - Default local development: http://localhost:5000

Both components must run simultaneously for the application to work. For production deployments (like Railway), they can be hosted separately or together.

# Verify installation
dotnet --version
```

**Expected output:** `8.0.xxx`

---

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

**All Platforms:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ryan6t4/JustWatch-search.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd JustWatch-search
```

---

## üöÄ Running the Application Locally

### Complete Setup (First Time)

You need **TWO terminal windows** running simultaneously.

#### Terminal 1: Start the Proxy Server

```bash
# Navigate to the proxy directory
cd JustWatchProxy

# Restore NuGet packages (downloads dependencies)
dotnet restore

# Run the proxy server on port 8080
dotnet run --urls "http://localhost:8080"
```

**Expected output:**
```
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:8080
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
```

‚úÖ **Keep this terminal running!** Do NOT close it.

> **Note:** If you see 404 errors when accessing `http://localhost:8080/` directly, this is normal. The proxy server doesn't have a homepage - it only responds to specific API endpoints.

---

#### Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Application

Open a **NEW terminal window** (keep Terminal 1 running!) and execute:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd JustWatchSearch

# Restore NuGet packages
dotnet restore

# Run the Blazor WebAssembly application
dotnet run
```

**Expected output:**
```
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
```

---

#### Step 3: Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

or (if HTTPS is configured):

```
https://localhost:5001
```

üéâ **You should now see the JustWatch Search application!**

---

### Subsequent Runs

After the first setup, you only need to run the applications:

**Terminal 1 - Proxy Server:**
```bash
cd JustWatchProxy
dotnet run --urls "http://localhost:8080"
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd JustWatchSearch
dotnet run
```

Then open **http://localhost:5000** in your browser.

## üöÇ Deploying to Railway

Railway is a modern platform that makes deploying .NET applications simple, with automatic port detection and no Docker required.

This project includes Railway configuration files (`start.sh`, `nixpacks.toml`, `railway.json`, and `Procfile`) that enable automatic deployment.

### Prerequisites

1. A [Railway account](https://railway.app/) (free tier available)
2. [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli) (optional, but recommended)

### Deployment Architecture

This application consists of two services that can be deployed separately on Railway:

1. **JustWatchProxy** - Backend API service (runs on port assigned by Railway's `PORT` variable)
2. **JustWatchSearch** - Frontend Blazor WebAssembly app

### Deployment Steps

#### Option 1: Deploy via Railway Web UI (Recommended)

**Step 1: Deploy the Proxy Service**

1. **Create a New Project on Railway**
   - Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Connect and select your `JustWatch-search` repository

2. **Configure the Proxy Service**
   - Railway will auto-detect the .NET application using the provided configuration files
   - Set the environment variable `SERVICE` to `proxy`
   - Railway will automatically set the `PORT` environment variable
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Note the public URL assigned to this service (e.g., `https://your-proxy.railway.app`)

**Step 2: Deploy the Frontend Service**

1. **Add a New Service to the Same Project**
   - In your Railway project, click "New Service"
   - Select "GitHub Repo" and choose the same repository
   
2. **Configure the Frontend Service**
   - Set the environment variable `SERVICE` to `frontend`
   - Update the frontend to point to your proxy service:
     - Either set an environment variable `ProxyUrl` to your proxy service URL
     - Or update `JustWatchSearch/wwwroot/appsettings.json` with the proxy URL before deploying
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Access Your Application**
   - The frontend will be accessible at its Railway-assigned URL
   - Both services are now running and communicating

#### Option 2: Deploy via Railway CLI

```bash
# Install Railway CLI (if not already installed)
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy Proxy Service
railway up
# Then set SERVICE=proxy in Railway dashboard

# For the frontend, create another service in the same project via the dashboard
# Set SERVICE=frontend and configure the ProxyUrl
```

#### Option 3: Deploy Using Root Directory (Alternative)

Instead of using the `SERVICE` environment variable, you can deploy each service separately by setting the **Root Directory**:

**For Proxy Service:**
- Set **Root Directory** to `JustWatchProxy`
- Set **Start Command**: `dotnet run --project JustWatchProxy.csproj --urls "http://0.0.0.0:${PORT:-8080}"`

**For Frontend Service:**
- Set **Root Directory** to `JustWatchSearch`
- Set **Start Command**: `dotnet run --project JustWatchSearch.csproj`
- Set environment variable `ProxyUrl` to your proxy service URL

### Configuration Files

This repository includes the following Railway configuration files:

- **`start.sh`**: Startup script that determines which service to run based on the `SERVICE` environment variable
- **`nixpacks.toml`**: Build configuration for Railway's Nixpacks builder
- **`railway.json`**: Railway-specific deployment configuration
- **`Procfile`**: Process file for service startup

### Environment Variables

**Proxy Service:**
- `SERVICE=proxy` - Tells the startup script to run the proxy server
- `PORT` - Automatically set by Railway (default: 8080)

**Frontend Service:**
- `SERVICE=frontend` - Tells the startup script to run the frontend
- `ProxyUrl` - URL of your deployed proxy service (e.g., `https://your-proxy.railway.app`)

### Configuration for Railway

The application is already configured to work with Railway:

- **Proxy Server**: Reads port from `PORT` environment variable (Railway auto-assigns this)
- **Frontend**: Reads proxy URL from `appsettings.json` or environment configuration
- **Nixpacks**: Automatically installs .NET 8 SDK and builds both projects

### Important Notes

- Railway automatically assigns ports - no need for Docker port mapping
- Both services need to be running for the application to work
- Update the `ProxyUrl` in the frontend's configuration to point to your deployed proxy service
- Railway's free tier includes 500 hours of usage per month (across all projects)
- The `start.sh` script is executable and will be run by Railway on startup

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

**Error:** `Failed to bind to address http://localhost:8080: address already in use`

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Find the process
netstat -ano | findstr :8080

# Kill it (replace PID with actual number)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Find the process
lsof -i :8080

# Kill it (replace PID with actual number)
kill -9 <PID>
```

**Alternative:** Run on a different port
```bash
dotnet run --urls "http://localhost:9000"
```

---

### 404 Error on Proxy

**Issue:** Getting 404 when accessing `http://localhost:8080/`

**Explanation:** This is **normal**! The proxy doesn't have a homepage. Test with:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8080/health

# Linux/macOS
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

---

### CORS Errors

**Issue:** CORS policy errors in browser

**Solution:** Make sure the proxy is running on port 8080 **before** starting the frontend.

**Checklist:**
1. ‚úÖ Proxy running on `http://localhost:8080`
2. ‚úÖ Frontend running on `http://localhost:5000`
3. ‚úÖ Both terminals are open

---

### Build Errors

**Issue:** Application won't compile

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
dotnet clean
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

---

### .NET Command Not Found

**Windows:**
1. Close and reopen terminal
2. If still not working, reinstall .NET SDK

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Add to PATH
export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet
export PATH=$PATH:$DOTNET_ROOT:$DOTNET_ROOT/tools

# Make permanent (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export DOTNET_ROOT=$HOME/.dotnet' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$DOTNET_ROOT:$DOTNET_ROOT/tools' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
